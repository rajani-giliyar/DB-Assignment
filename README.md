1) The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is established through a foreign key constraint. In the "Product" table, the column "category_id" serves as a foreign key referencing the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table. This means that each product in the "Product" table is associated with a category defined in the "Product_Category" table.


2)  To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using foreign key constraints. When defining the schema for the "Product" table, you would specify the "category_id" column as a foreign key referencing the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that any value assigned to the "category_id" column in the "Product" table must exist in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table.
